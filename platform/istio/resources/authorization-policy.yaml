# Authorization policies for Istio mesh
# https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/
#
# Note: We do NOT apply a mesh-wide deny-all policy because:
# 1. It would break system namespaces (kube-system, istio-system)
# 2. Each application namespace should define its own policies
# 3. This file provides baseline policies for observability

---
# Allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from all meshed workloads
# Applied when observability stack is deployed (Phase 3.1)
